			<h2>What is NodeJs?</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Node.js is a way you can make clean efficient server side applications</li>
				<li>It is javascipt that can run on your server</li>
				<li>Used to make applications that can handle multiple requests from users like
					<ul><li>Instant messaging apps</li>
					<li>Social media sites</li>
					<li>Games</li></ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

		<article id="Why">
			<br>
			<h2>Using NodeJS</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Same syntax to javascript with objects function attributes and variables</li>
				<li>Remember that Node.js will be running on your server continuously</li>
				<li>Node.js has many built in functions that leverage the power of it's approach</li>
			</ul>  
		
			<h2>Why choose NodeJS over PHP</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>In some cases PHP can be slower and use more resources</li>
				<li>Node.js is fast, efficient and updates in real time</li>
				<li>Node.js will handle multiple requests from one user while still executing script</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>IDE</h2>
			<p>Setting up your server with an IDE like WebStorm or IntelliJ can be very simple.</p>
			<p>Fist you need to make sure that the Node.js is installed and your IDE knows how to handle it. Most modern IDE will be equipped with Node.js, but sometimes you will need to configure your IDE manually. After that configure your IDE so it knows what port to use on your server. Once you have done that it is only a few lines of code to get your server running.</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
var http = require ('http');

function onRequest (request, repsonse){
	
	console.log("A user made a request" + request.url);
	repsonse.writeHead(200,{"Context-Type":"text/plain"});
	response.write("Some Data");
	response.end();
}

http.createServer(onRequest).listen(8888);
conlsole.log("Server is running...");
			</pre>
			<p>In this example we are using a local host port 8888. To display this in your browser, just go to your browser and type in "localhost:8888". If you see a webpage that prints "Some Data" in the top left corner, your server is running correctly.</p>
			<p>Now if you want to send the user some html you will have to modify the file slightly. First make sure you have an html file stored with your Node.js file. Mine is called layout.html. Then use this code to display it to the user.</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
var http = require('http');
var fs = require('fs');

//404 response
function send404Response(response){
    response.writeHead(404,{"Context-Type": "text/plain"});
    response.write("Error 404: Page not found!");
    response.end();
}

//Handle user request
function onRequest(request, response){
    if(request.method == 'GET' && request.url == '/' || request.url == '/layout.html'){
        response.writeHead(200,{"Context-Type": "text/html"});
        fs.createReadStream("./layout.html").pipe(response);
    }
    else{
        send404Response(response);
    }
}


http.createServer(onRequest).listen(8888);
console.log("Server is now running....");
			</pre>
			<p>The 404 repsonse we added in case the user entered a page that didn't exist on our server.</p>

			<h2>Linux</h2>
			<p>The first thing you will need to do is install Node.js, npm, and express from your local repositories.</p>
			<p>After that you will have to create a package.json file.  It's purpose is to let Node.js what you are currently setting up.  The most important part is the dependencies.  They are provided in the format "dependancy" : "verion" where version can be "*" in order to grab whatever version is available.  After creating a package.json, you then run the command "npm install" to install all of those dependancies.  A basic package.json will look something like this:</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
{
	"name": "Express-web-app",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"dependencies":
	{
		"express": "~4.0.0",
		"ejs": "~1.0.0",
		"body-parser": "*"
	}
}
			</pre>
			<p>In this example we will be separating the server from the app for sake of modularity.  Inside of "server.js" we have to load express by using the "require" keyword.  Express is a library that makes it easier to handle full html pages with Node.js.  We then declare our app to be of the express type and load the app "main.js" using require.  Then, in line 4, we specify the "view" directory, which in this case is "/myHTML".  This tells the app to look for html pages in that directory.  Lines 5 and 6 set up "ejs" which is a library that helps us render the html.  Finallys, we tell the app to listen to port 3000.  Typically you would want to host on the standard port 80, however that requires root permissions on most machines.</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
var express=require('express');
var app=express();
require('./main.js')(app);
app.set('views',__dirname + '/myHTML');
app.set('views engine', 'ejs');
app.engine('html', require('ejs').renderFile);
var server=app.listen(3000,function(){
	console.log("Express is running on port 3000");
});
			</pre>
			<p>What to include in the main.js will be covered in the next section <b>Routing</b>, but for now, assume that is has been finished.  In order to start your server, simply run the command "node server.js".  To test this, use your browser to navigate to "localhost:3000".</p>
		</article>

		<article id="Routing">
			<br>
			<h2>Routing</h2>
			<p>One major difference between Node.js and an Apache server is that a Node.js server does not automatically handle the routing for you.  Instead, you have to handle all of the request for files yourself.  One thing to note is that nearly every request for file by URL is in fact a GET request.</p>
			<p>First we must require express for HTML handling and bodyParser to allow us to parse POST requests.</p>
			<p>The general format for parsing is appname.method("where_request_was_directed", function(request,response){
				Stuff to do.
			}).</p>
			<xmp class="prettyprint linenums">
var express=require('express');
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
module.exports=function(app)
{
	app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({
		extended: true
	}));
	app.post('/', function(request, response){
		var name = request.body.user_name;
		var password = request.body.user_password;
		console.log(name);
		console.log(password);
		response.writeHead(200, {'content-type':'text/html'});
		response.write("<center>");
		response.write("Hello " + name);
		response.write("<br><a href=\"/content1\">content1</a>");
		response.write("</center>");
		response.end();
	});
	app.get('/content1',function(request,response){
		response.render('content1.html');
	})
	app.get('/', function(request,response){
		response.render('index.html');
	})
}
			</xmp>
			<p>One thing to note in the post function is how we send a response.  We start with response.writeHead(status,{what_should_included_in_header}).  Typically you'll want to respond with a status of 200 and the header should at least specify the content-type.  The content-type can be anything from plaintext, to in-line HTML, to entire JavaScript and CSS files.  After you are done writing content to send, you will finish with response.end();</p>
			<p>For standard page navigation, express and ejs give us an easy way to display pages simply by using response.render(location_of_file_relative_to_views_directory);</p>
